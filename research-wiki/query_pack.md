# Research Query Pack

## Current Active Route: GeoRoute-AdaTAD (2026-07-28)

- Objective: offline TAD under a native VideoMAE token budget. Test whether
  continuous geometry support plus a free-token residual and depth routing
  preserve high-tIoU localization better than unstructured token selection at
  lower measured end-to-end cost.
- Status: `failed_p1_infrastructure_storage_exhaustion_no_metric`. The sealed P0 parent from
  [`4a9358d`](https://github.com/yuzbo/OpenTAD_C3_CoarseClean_20260702/tree/4a9358d1fba4bde9aa7693a94f7e4dfc95d31ecc)
  remains `PASS_MECHANICAL_ONLY`. Clean dispatcher snapshot
  [`6a9bba62`](https://github.com/yuzbo/OpenTAD_C3_CoarseClean_20260702/tree/6a9bba6222c18a468c3bd410edac89a4afdea189)
  completed bootstrap Job `1196062` (`0:0`) and atomically submitted the seven
  matched P1 leaves `1196071`--`1196077`. All seven later failed `1:0` while
  publishing per-epoch checkpoints after `/data` reached 100% usage; the
  namespace had accumulated 63 GB. Result-blind selector `1196078` remains
  dependency-held and emitted no decision. This is immutable infrastructure
  failure evidence only: no P1 mAP, cost, A-MoD result, empirical support,
  official-test evidence, or paper claim exists.
- P1 is the first scientific screen: matched dense, fixed lattice,
  lattice-plus-geometry side-channel, random, free TokenSelect, ROI-only, and
  hybrid. Free TokenSelect winning both high tIoU and total cost kills the ROI
  main claim. P2 promotes only the winner to seeds/budgets; P3 is frozen,
  second-detector/dataset and sealed-test closure.
- The prior quota hold was cleared, but P1 is now storage-held. P0 replacement Gate `1181172` passed the
  real uint8 180x320 path; roots `1181007` and `1181177` remain immutable
  scheduler diagnostics only. The fresh namespace is
  `/data/run01/sczc063/yuzibo/projects/c3_lowres_action_probe/georoute_adatad_6a9bba62_p1p3_20260727_222913`.
  Its bootstrap and submission receipts bind the sealed P0 suite SHA
  `a6f8ea041345cdc400c7f8a4f478c037cb66c8cfd3c19edb09d454ff363ce0b1`.
  A replacement requires a new namespace, result-blind storage-capacity
  preflight, and final-EMA-only or explicitly bounded checkpoint retention.
  P2/P3 remain absent and result-gated.
- FlashVID was audited as a VLLM reference, not a GeoRoute result. Its 10%
  retention result is 57.9/58.4 = 99.1% relative score after a full vision
  encoder, so it cannot support native-pre-backbone or detector-gradient
  claims. Its relevance-diversity-motion correspondence principle is only a
  conditional P2 scout-side comparator after a P1 hybrid win.

## Continuous-RoI / Native-Crop Record (Frozen or Held)

- The original spatial goal is source-coordinate, variable `(cx, cy, w, h)`
  crop tubes at native local pixel density while retaining the full temporal
  axis. Dense 160/224/256 resizing is R0 headroom control, not a crop result.
- Continuous-RoI S2 exact-nine training (`1177668`--`1177676`) is sealed as
  `PASS_TRAINING_ONLY`: 60 epochs, 4,800 successful updates per cell,
  final-EMA-only, and no official-test opening. It is neither crop
  sufficiency, cost, mAP, nor a learned-policy result.
- Its fixed/variable reference protocol is `HOLD`: common physical centers,
  Sobol generator identity, candidate-ID authority, no-GT raw entrypoint and
  privileged join/tie/statistics are not jointly frozen. Only a result-blind
  v2.2 corrigendum is allowed; no official test or S3 learned policy follows.
- Native-Crop S1 merely established source-native crop data/model/gradient and
  no-leak mechanics. The fixed 128 candidate library is D0 diagnostic only.
  Historical S1/R0 campaigns must not be resumed, combined, or presented as
  crop GO/KILL evidence.

## C3 / DUCA Historical Baselines and Negative Memory

- Project-wide target remains offline, task-aware redundant-computation
  removal with protected mAP@0.6/0.7 and full decode-to-NMS cost. It is not
  causal or Online TAD.
- DUCA is a frozen, unproven full-window candidate. Its honest contract is
  `offline_full_window + runtime_generated + cache_free + jointly_trained`.
  It uses a low-cost coarse probe, transition/boundary-sensitive selection,
  fixed-K positions and AdaTAD-derived components; it cannot be called an
  unmodified official AdaTAD plugin or a paper method before matched evidence.
- Do not revive these mistakes: actionness top-k as the final selector;
  post-hoc gap repair/uniform scaffolds that hide learning failure; old-commit
  mAP as current evidence; smoke/gradient checks as utility evidence; dense
  X3D as a low-cost main probe; dynamic MUST as a main contribution; or FLOPs
  without trained end-to-end cost.
- Known failure mechanisms remain valuable: actionness focuses action interiors
  rather than boundaries; complex coverage constraints can collapse toward
  uniform; GAS-VT train/apply mismatch and hard repair invalidated its main
  reading; selected-axis geometry can damage high-tIoU; and requested,
  effective, unique, padded and actual backbone budgets must be logged
  separately.

## Non-Negotiable Evidence Rules

1. Match commit, data, pretrained initialization, updates, seeds, token budget
   and detector/head before comparing selection methods.
2. Report high-tIoU, short-action/boundary diagnostics and measured full-stack
   p50/p95 latency, memory and energy. FLOPs or random-init profiling alone
   cannot establish efficiency.
3. Training-only, smoke, precheck, pending or failed jobs never become
   empirical support. Test/validation GT, teacher signals and raw prediction
   caches must never participate in inference decisions.
4. Any route that fails its matched control narrows or dies instead of gaining
   extra selector heads or loss weights. Preserve failed evidence in the
   experiment record and `anti_repetition.md`.
